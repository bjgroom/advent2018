advent 2018

This year I'll be completing each day the same day the challenge is issued, possibly using some inspiration from adventofcode.reddit.comto learn about unknown-to-me syntax, modules and data structures in C or Python 2. I may also explore other languages here and there, especially since elegant, odd and interesting solutions show up so often on reddit. A humbling experience to be sure.
