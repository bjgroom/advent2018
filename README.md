#advent 2018#

This year I'll be completing each day the same day the challenge is issued, quite likely using inspiration from the daily threads at adventofcode.reddit.com to learn about unknown-to-me syntax, modules and data structures in C or Python 2. I may also explore other languages here and there, especially since elegant, odd and interesting solutions show up so often on reddit. A humbling experience to be sure.
